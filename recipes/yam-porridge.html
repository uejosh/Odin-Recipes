    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Yam porridge or Asaro is a delicious Nigerian yam dish cooked in a well-seasoned pepper mix until soft and fluffy with some yam chunks. It is very quick and easy to make. It makes a perfect dinner or lunch and it is also a party favourite.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Tuber of yam</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper (Tatashe)</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet chillies (Ata Rodo)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Palm oil</li>
        <li>Beef seasoning powder or stock cubes</li>
        <li>Mackerel fish cleaned (substitute with dry fish or smoked fish)</li>
        <li>Cup Beef stock (optional)</li>
        <li>Spinach or any green vegetable</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and cut yam into chunks, rinse and cover with cold water and set aside Roughly blend red bell pepper, scotch bonnet chill and onions together with water and set aside</li>
        <li>Boil the fish for about 5 minutes with seasoning cube, salt. Save fish broth for the porridge if you are not using beef stock. De-bone fish, flake and set aside</li>
        <li>Place a small pan on medium heat, add palm oil and heat for about 2 minutes. Add chopped onions and fry till onions are translucent. Take it off the heat and set aside. This is to be added to the yam at the tail end of the cooking.</li>
        <li>Place a large pan on medium heat; add yam chunks, blended pepper mixture and enough water to cover it (about one cm above the yam or keep it at the same level), add salt, seasoning cube and bring to boil till yam is almost tender. Reduce the heat if you have to avoid the yam burning. Add stock or water to yam in between cooking if need be.</li>
        <li>Once yam is almost tender add already heated palm oil to the yam and continue to cook till yam is tender. Using a back of a wooden ladle, break yam into pieces but not to puree, leave some yam chunks if you desire.</li>
        <li>Stir in the flaked fish and stir together gently into the yam to avoid breaking the fish and yam more, cook for another 2-3 minutes. Finally, add chopped spinach (or any other green vegetable), fold into porridge and cook for another 2 minutes. Take it off the heat as the vegetable would continue to cook just before you serve the dish.</li>
    </ol>
